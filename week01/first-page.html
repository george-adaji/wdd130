    <h1>My First Page</h1>
    <p>My favorite color is: Blue
    <p> I am learning web development

    </p> I’m George Adaji, and I’m excited to be part of this Software Engineering class. I’ve always had a passion for
    technology, and I’m thrilled to be diving deeper into the world of coding and problem-solving. My main interests lie
    in
    web development, mobile apps, systems design, machine learning, coding etc and I’m looking forward to learning new
    tools, frameworks, and best practices to become a better engineer.
    When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me gaming, contributing to open-source projects, attending tech events.
    I’m
    excited to collaborate with all of you, share ideas, and learn from each other throughout this course.
